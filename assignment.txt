funcsDB() {
	should host list of Data which  contians 3 type of data 1. int, 2. string, 3. float eg string Name: Vishal, float Age:24.5 and int Year : 1995. list will look like {(vishal,24.5,1995), (arvind, 25.5, 194)} 
	Each  Data should be exposed through interface, based on type of data has been requested.
}

There are 2 thread, each has below resonsiblity.

thread1{
	it should fetch data  name,age,year from funcDB and club together for 3 iteration, each iteration would request all 3 data (vishal, 24.5,1995). it keep iterating until list in funcDB doesnot get empty.
	it should serialize the list of 3 element fetched using json and sends to thread2.
	until funcDB list finishes once list finished intimate to thread2 using channel and stop sending.
}

Thread2 {
	it should receive data over rest and parse it and convert to protobuf and send over grpc.
	it should stop receiving data once signal through channel.
	and resume again once singaled through channel.
}

Thread3 {
	consume grpc data from thread2 and print. 
}

stage 1: funcDB and thread1, thread2  rest api consumption and channel signaling part from thread1 Implementation.
stage2: protobuf grpc commuinication from thread2 and thread 3 implementation.

Note: Stage 2 should be done only after stage1 completion.
